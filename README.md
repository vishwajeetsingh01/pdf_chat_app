# PDF Chat App

*The **PDF Chat App** allows users to upload PDF files and interact with the content through a chatbot interface. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) to enable users to ask questions, summarize content, or retrieve specific information from the uploaded PDFs. This app is ideal for anyone who needs to quickly extract insights or explore large PDF documents interactively.*<br>

## Features<br>
* **PDF Upload:** Users can upload a PDF file to the app.<br>
* **Interactive Chat:** Once the PDF is uploaded, users can chat with the app to extract relevant information, get summaries, or ask specific questions.<br>
* **Text Extraction:** The app reads the content of the PDF and makes it searchable.<br>
* **Contextual Responses:** The chatbot provides responses based on the content of the uploaded PDF.<br>

## Technologies Used<br>
* **Frontend:** Streamlit<br>
* **Backend:** Python<br>
* **NLP:** OpenAI GPT-4 or similar language models for text-based interaction.<br>
* **Real-time Processing:** Instantaneous interaction with the document content.<br>
* **PDF Processing:** PyPDF2 and other Python libraries for text extraxtion.<br>
* **File Storage:** Local or cloud-based storage for PDFs.<br>

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* Python 3.11+<br>
* Streamlit (for frontend)<br>
* Dependencies (listed below)<br>

### Installation
1. Clone the repositery:<br>
git clone https://github.com/vishwajeetsingh01/pdf_chat_app.git<br>
cd pdf-chat-app

2. Create a virtual environment in the terminal:<br>
python  -m venv .venv

3. Activate virtual environment:<br>
.venv\Scripts\activate

**Note:** *If you get error than fire the below commond: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass*

4. Install dependencies:<br>
pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the application:<br>
streamlit run app.py

Now, the app should be running locally at http://localhost:8501 and the Network URL will be available at http://localhost:172.16.1.196.8501.

## File Upload
To interact with the PDF, simply click on the Upload PDF button on the frontend, select a file, and the chat interface will be ready to respond based on the content of the document.

## Usage
**Chat with PDF:** After uploading a PDF, ask questions related to its contents (e.g., "What is the summary of this document?", "Tell me about the second chapter.").<br>
**Extract Information:** You can ask for specific data or quotes directly (e.g., "What is the value of X in section 3?").<br>
**Summarization:** Ask the bot to provide a concise summary of the entire document or specific sections.<br>
